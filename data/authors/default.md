I am currently working at [ExaWizards Inc.](https://exawizards.com/en/) as a ML/MLOps Engineer and developing the MLOps Platform to accelerate the process from PoC to service to scale ML business. With my experience as both a researcher and an engineer, I am passionate about quickly turning research-stage technologies into services and implementing them in society in a way that delivers value to many people.

I am also a headquarter member of [cvpaper.challenge](http://xpaperchallenge.org/cv/), and leads [XCCV research group](http://xpaperchallenge.org/cv/xccv) collaborating with PRMU/CVIM mentorship programs. My research interests are primarily in robust machine learning for developing reliable and real-world ready ML systems.
