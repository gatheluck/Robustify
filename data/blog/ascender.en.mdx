## Background

Hello, this is [@gatheluck](https://twitter.com/gatheluck).
This post is also the sixth post of ["研究コミュニティ cvpaper.challenge 〜CV 分野の今を映し,トレンドを作り出す〜 Advent Calendar 2022"](https://adventar.org/calendars/8089).

Because [cvpaper.challnege](http://xpaperchallenge.org/cv/), where I belong to, conducts research activities in groups,
there are frequent opportunities for group members to develop experimental code in different environments for a single project.
However, since there has been no common template or coding style guideline for our group,
sharing and reusing of code or agile style team development had not been very successful.
Therefore, as part of the meta-survey activities of our [XCCV group](http://xpaperchallenge.org/cv/xccv),
a project template [Ascender](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender) was developed and released as a public OSS in July 2022.
We have been continuously developing and maintaining it after its release,
and the latest version is [`v0.1.2`](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender/releases/tag/v0.1.2) at the time of this blog post publication.

This article provides a brief introduction to [Ascender](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender)'s features and usage.
If this is your first time to know about it, we hope you will consider using it in your next project.
We are continuously developing, so if you have any requests for new features or improvements, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
