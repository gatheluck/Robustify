## Background

Hello, this is [@gatheluck](https://twitter.com/gatheluck).
This post is also the sixth post of ["研究コミュニティ cvpaper.challenge 〜CV 分野の今を映し,トレンドを作り出す〜 Advent Calendar 2022"](https://adventar.org/calendars/8089).

Because [cvpaper.challnege](http://xpaperchallenge.org/cv/), where I belong to, conducts research activities in groups,
there are frequent opportunities for group members to develop experimental code in different environments for a single project.
However, since there has been no common template or coding style guideline for our group,
sharing and reusing of code or agile style team development had not been very successful.
Therefore, as part of the meta-survey activities of our [XCCV group](http://xpaperchallenge.org/cv/xccv),
a project template [Ascender](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender) was developed and released as a public OSS in July 2022.
We have been continuously developing and maintaining it after its release,
and the latest version is [`v0.1.2`](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender/releases/tag/v0.1.2) at the time of this blog post publication.

This article provides a brief introduction to [Ascender](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender)'s features and usage.
If this is your first time to know about it, we hope you will consider using it in your next project.
We are continuously developing, so if you have any requests for new features or improvements, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request.

## What is Ascender

[Ascender](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender) is a GitHub repository template for research projects using Python.
The main features are as follows:

- **Container-based virtualization**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to reduce development environment dependencies and improve portability.
- **Package management**: Package management using [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) improves reproducibility of the same environment.
- **Coding style**: Automatically formats coding style using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [Flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8),
  and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).
- **Static type check**: Static type checking with [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) improves code reliability.
- **Test**: Easy to integrate test code with [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).
- **GitHub related features**: Basic [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows)
  which is kicked when pull request is created, [issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates),
  etc. have been implemented.

There are already widely used templates for ML projects in Python,
such as [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science)
and [Lightning-Hydra-Template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template),
but [Ascender](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender) have focused on team development and have tried not to be restricted by specific libraries.
