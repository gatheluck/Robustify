## TL;DR

- It is simple to build a Docker environment using Colima, if you cannot use Docker Desktop on macOS.

## Background

[Docker Desktop has been paid for since March 31, 2022](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/)
(However, companies with less than 250 employees, less than $10 million in annual revenue,
personal or educational use and non-profit OSS will continue to be free of charge).
As a result, the Docker Desktop alternative is now required to use Docker for free on macOS etc.

There are several alternatives to Docker Desktop,
such as [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube),
[Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima),
but currently [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) looks to be the best in terms of simplicity of setup.

## What is Colima?

Colima (Containers in Lima) is a derivative project of Lima,
as suggested by its name, which aims to build a Docker/Kuberbetes environment on macOS with minimal setup.

The mechanism of running Docker with Colima is basically the same as with Docker Desktop.
A Docker daemon (`dockerd`) is started in a Linux VM launched by Colima,
and Docker clients on the host can access the Docker daemon via `docker.socket` which is mounted from VM to the host.

## Install

Let's install Colima.
Colima supports [multiple installation methods](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md) including [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/),
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) and [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

```shell
% brew install colima  # When installing with Homebrew
```

If the version information can be obtained with `colima version` command,
the Colima installation is complete.

Colima allows us to [choose a runtime](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima#runtimes).
Since we want to use Docker as the runtime, install the Docker client here.

```shell
% brew install docker
```

## Colima 101

This section describes the basic usage of Colima.
The following information is based on the [`v0.5.2`](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/releases/tag/v0.5.2) version of Colima,
so be careful if you have installed a major different version.

You can create a new instance of VM (or specify an existing instance) and start it with the `colima start` command.
For example, the following command creates a new instance specifying the number of CPUs, memory size (GB) and disk size (GB),
mounts `$HOME/` and starts it. The `:w` is required to make the volume writable.
The name of the instance to be created can be specified with the `--profile` option (default value is `default`),
and the runtime type can be specified with the `--runtime` option (default value is `docker`).

```shell
% colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8 --disk 100 --mount $HOME/:w
```

If the instance is successfully created, the `colima list` command should show an instance named `default` and the `STATUS` should be `Running`.
In this state, the Docker client can communicate with the Docker daemon via `docker.sock` and Docker is ready to use.

To stop the instance, use the `colima stop` command. And the instance is automatically stopped when the PC is rebooted.
The stopped instance can be restarted by `colima start` command. If the `--profile` option is not specified, the `default` instance is started.

The instance configuration can be updated by `colima start --edit` command.
However, the disk size cannot be changed after the instance is created.

## Tips

### Insecure registries setting

In Docker Desktop, insecure registries can be configured using the GUI.
In Colima, you can [configure insecure registries by `colima start --edit` command](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md#how-to-customize-docker-config-eg-add-insecure-registries).
Find the following part in the contents displayed by `colima start --edit` command and update the `docker` section according to the EXAMPLE.

```shell
# EXAMPLE - add insecure registries
# docker:
#   insecure-registries:
#     - myregistry.com:5000
#     - host.docker.internal:5000
#
# Colima default behaviour: buildkit enabled
# Default: {}
docker: {}
```

## Summary

In this article, I have explained about how to build a Docker environment on macOS using Colima.
I think Colima is superior to similar alternatives in terms of simplicity of setup.
